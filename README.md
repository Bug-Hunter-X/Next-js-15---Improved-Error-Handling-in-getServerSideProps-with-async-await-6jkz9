# Next.js 15: Improved Error Handling in getServerSideProps with async/await

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using `async/await` within the `getServerSideProps` function in Next.js 15 and provides a solution for robust error handling.

## Problem

When an error occurs inside an `async` function within `getServerSideProps`, the standard `try...catch` block might not effectively capture the error. This often leads to a generic 500 server error with limited debugging information, making it difficult to identify the root cause.

## Solution

The provided solution enhances error handling by meticulously logging errors to the console and returning a proper error response.  This ensures that the user receives a meaningful error message and that developers have detailed information for debugging.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
